This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#plot(cars)



data1 <- read.table(file = "~/Desktop/softwarecarpentry/project/software-carpentry-october-2015/output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header = TRUE)

countryNames <- data1$country

country1 <- subset(data1, countryNames == "Egypt")
country2 <- subset(data1, countryNames == "Cuba")
country3 <- subset(data1, countryNames == "Zimbabwe")

plot(country1$year, country1$gdpPercap, main = "Egypt GDP by Year", xlab = "Year", ylab ="GDP", col = "red")

plot(country2$year, country2$gdpPercap, main = "Cuba GDP by Year", xlab = "Year", ylab ="GDP", col = "red")

plot(country3$year, country3$gdpPercap, main = "Zimbabwe GDP by Year", xlab = "Year", ylab ="GDP", col = "red")



```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
